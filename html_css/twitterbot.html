    Recently finished reviewing some HTML and CSS skills. Then I studied Javascript deeper than I had in tbe past. Now I'm currently working on
        learning react more so I can then use that to connect the frontend of this website to the backend of my python and mySQL.
        <br>
        Once I have that properly done I'll begin to work on expanding and filtering data collected to try and gain the best insight
        which will then if successful lead to more consistent profits when trading.
