        &emsp; Welcome to my website! I currently work at Apple as a Genius and I am working on moving to my next career as a full time software developer.
            I love the idea of being able to automate so many aspects of our lives with technology and understanding and solving problems using technology
            and programming has been a lot of fun for me. I currently live with my girlfriend of 7 years, in a house we bought together 2 years ago, and
            while I love my current job I'm looking to try and advance to something that can better support having a bigger family. I've done all sorts of
            fun and sometimes crazy projects.
        over time either woodworking or technical with hardware and software. I created a tv tray with a marbled
        looking wood top using stains, a tree platform you might call it(that survived another tree falling on it), and I
        assembled a 3-D printer, my first computer, and a moped. Most recently I've been focusing on the software
        development side of things and created a twitter bot. Previously I've created games like minesweeper,
        android apps, or websites. My current project is this website, initially created to host data pulled from a MySQL
        database that the twitter bot outputs data to but now is becoming a bit more than that.
